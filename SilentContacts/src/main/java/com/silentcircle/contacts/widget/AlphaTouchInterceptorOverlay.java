/**
 * A View that other Views can use to create a touch-interceptor layer above
 * their other sub-views. This layer can be enabled and disabled; when enabled,
 * clicks are intercepted and passed to a listener.
 *
 * Also supports an alpha layer to dim the content underneath.  By default, the
 * alpha layer is the same View as the touch-interceptor layer.  However, for
 * some use-cases, you want a few Views to not be dimmed, but still have touches
 * intercepted (for example, {@link CarouselTab}'s label appears above the alpha
 * layer).  In this case, you can specify the View to use as the alpha layer via
 * setAlphaLayer(); in this case you are responsible for managing the z-order of
 * the alpha-layer with respect to your other sub-views.
 *
 * Typically, you would not use this class directly, but rather use another class
 * that uses it, for example {@link FrameLayoutWithOverlay}.
