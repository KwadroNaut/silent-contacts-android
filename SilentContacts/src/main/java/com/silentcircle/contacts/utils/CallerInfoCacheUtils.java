 * Utilities for managing CallerInfoCache.
 *
 * The cache lives in Phone package and is used as fallback storage when database lookup is slower
 * than expected. It remembers some information necessary for responding to incoming calls
 * (e.g. custom ringtone settings, send-to-voicemail).
 *
 * Even though the cache will be updated periodically, Contacts app can request the cache update
 * via broadcast Intent. This class provides that mechanism, and possibly other misc utilities
 * for the update mechanism.
