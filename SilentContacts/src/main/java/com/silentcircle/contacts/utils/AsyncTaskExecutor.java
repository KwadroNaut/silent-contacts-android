/**
 * Interface used to submit {@link AsyncTask} objects to run in the background.

 * This interface has a direct parallel with the {@link Executor} interface. It exists to decouple
 * the mechanics of AsyncTask submission from the description of how that AsyncTask will execute.
 * <p>
 * One immediate benefit of this approach is that testing becomes much easier, since it is easy to
 * introduce a mock or fake AsyncTaskExecutor in unit/integration tests, and thus inspect which
 * tasks have been submitted and control their execution in an orderly manner.
 * <p>
 * Another benefit in due course will be the management of the submitted tasks. An extension to this
 * interface is planned to allow Activities to easily cancel all the submitted tasks that are still
 * pending in the onDestroy() method of the Activity.
