 * <p>
 * The spec is written in 1996, and currently various types of "vCard 2.1" exist.
 * To handle real the world vCard formats appropriately and effectively, this class does not
 * obey with strict vCard 2.1.
 * In stead, not only vCard spec but also real world vCard is considered.
 * </p>
 * e.g. A lot of devices and softwares let vCard importer/exporter to use
 * the PNG format to determine the type of image, while it is not allowed in
 * the original specification. As of 2010, we can see even the FLV format
 * (possible in Japanese mobile phones).
