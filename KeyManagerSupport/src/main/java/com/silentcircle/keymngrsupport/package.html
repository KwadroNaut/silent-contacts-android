    <title>SilentCircle Key Manager for Android (SKA)</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>The rationale for the overall design of SilentCircle Key Manager for Android (SKA)</h2>

A SilentCircle application must be able to make sure that it really uses SKA and not another provider with the
same name/authority. Content provides can define permissions to restrict access to it, however a content resolver
cannot check which content provider it really uses. Thus we have to rules:
<ol>
  <li>A content provider can define, "Only resolvers with permission X can access may data"
  </li>
  <li>A content resolver <b>CANNOT</b> define, "I only want data from providers that require permission X."
  </li>
</ol>
Therefore, a rogue application could claim to be the authority for <code>com.silentcircle.keys</code> and feed malicious
data (or worse, proxy) being sent to/from content resolvers that access it.
<p/>
To circumvent this problem we need to enhance each SilentCircle application (only those that actually require
inter-working with SKA) to have an own small provider (Key Manager support provider) which is also restricted with
permission X. This permission is further restricted to use the same signing certificate property. With this
structure we can implement authorized mutual access.
<p/>
The main idea behind this is to have a set of communicating providers: one SKA key manager provider communicates with
<em>n</em> SilentCircle application key manager support providers. All provider use the same signing certificate
permissions to restrict this communication to a set of well known applications.

<h2>The call flows between the providers</h2>
The implementation of the CRUD functions requires several call flows. In addition we have a registration function
that provides identification of SKA to the applications.

Thus we have several call flows: registration, insert (create), query (read), update, and delete.

<h3>Registration flow</h3>
<ol>
  <li>SPA resolves the SKA provider (standard Android mechanism) and registers with SKA, using an interface to the SKA
      provider. According to point 1) above SKA knows that this register request comes from an application with correct
      permissions.</li>
  <li>SKA gets the name of requesting application (using some Android mechanisms, Binder.getCallingUid(), package
      manager, etc). However, because these are SilentCircle applications only, we also should assume they are well
      behaving and supply their names correctly. With this name SKA can determine the application's Key Manager support
      provider. SKA generates a token and sends it to the application's provider. Again, according to point 1) above,
      the application's Key Manager support provider knows that this token is indeed from SKA and stores it. This
      completes the registration and probably runs only once for each application.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Query flow</h3>
<ol>
  <li>SPA resolve the SKA provider and sends a query. The query does not reveal sensitive data to a provider because it
      contains the name of the queried key entry only. Thus a rogue provider could not learn much about it.</li>
  <li>SKA checks the query, sets up the result and includes the token that it sent to the application during
      registration into the result. SKA sends this data to the application.
  <li>The application gets the result and compares the token in the result data with the token it got during
      registration. If the token value matches the data was sent by SKA.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Insert key data flow</h3>
The insert flow is a bit more complex because a simple insert request would contain sensitive data. Thus we must make
sure only our SKA gets this data.

<ol>
  <li>the application stores the sensitive key data data first with its Key Manager support provider and gets back a
      transaction id that identifies this data.</li>
  <li>The application resolves the SKA provider and sends it an insert request that contains the transaction id.</li>
  <li>SKA checks the insert request, resolves the application's Key Manager support provider and queries it with this
      transaction number. Because of point 1) above the application's Key Manager support provider knows that it is
      indeed SKA that asks for the data and returns it.</li>
  <li>SKA stores the data and returns success to the application</li>
</ol>

<h3>The update flow</h3>
The update flow is similar to the insert flow.

<h3>The delete flow</h3>
The delete flow is similar to the query flow.

<h2>Application support</h2>
To minimize the effort to integrate these call flows into a SilentCircle application this package contains two classes
and an interface:
<ol>
    <li>The SupportProvider class. This is a <code>final</code> class and an application should not modify it.</li>
    <li>The KeyManagerSupport class. This class provides a set of functions to support the application to register with
        the KeyManager, and create, query, update, delete key entries.</li>
    <li>A listener interface as part of the KeyManagerSupport class. An application may register as a listener to
        receive some notifications. The most important notification is the <em>lock</em> notification. The
        Key Manager sends this notification if the user locks access to the key entries. In this case an application
        cannot access key entries any more. Also SilentCircle applications may also decide to close sensitive files,
        flush or delete critical data, etc. Which actions to take is part of the application logic.</li>
</ol>

The classes are available as a small <code>JAR</code> file. The package name for these classes is
<code>com.silentcircle.keymngrsupport</code>

<h2>Application Integration</h2>
<h3>Changes to <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code></h3>
An application that uses SKA needs to add some statements and declarations to its <code>AndroidManifest</code> file.
In a first step add the necessary permissions:
<pre>
    &lt;!-- SilentCircle permissions to use the key manager features -->
    &lt;permission android:name="com.silentcircle.keymngr.permission.READ_SC_KEY" android:protectionLevel="signature"
                android:label="@string/permission_read_km"/>
    &lt;permission android:name="com.silentcircle.keymngr.permission.WRITE_SC_KEY" android:protectionLevel="signature"
                android:label="@string/permission_write_km"/>
    &lt;uses-permission android:name="com.silentcircle.keymngr.permission.READ_SC_KEY"/>
    &lt;uses-permission android:name="com.silentcircle.keymngr.permission.WRITE_SC_KEY"/>
</pre>

In a next step add the support provider. To construct the authority name of the support key manager use the following
rule:
<pre>
    [package-name].keymngrsupport
</pre>
where <code>package-name</code> must be the same string as the manifest's <code>package</code> statement. The
the support provider must use the correct permission. The following code snippet shows how SilentPhone
defines its key manager support provider:
<pre>
     &lt;!-- The authority for this provider is: [package-name].keymngrsupport and it must use the permission -->
     &lt;provider
        android:name="com.silentcircle.keymngrsupport.SupportProvider"
        android:authorities="com.silentcircle.silentphone.keymngrsupport"
        android:permission="com.silentcircle.keymngr.permission.WRITE_SC_KEY"
        android:initOrder="2"
        android:enabled="true"
        android:exported="true"/>
</pre>

<h3>Using the key manager in an application</h3>
An application should check if the key manager is available and register with it at a very early stage during
application startup. If the key manager is ready then the application may access shared and private key data. The
following code example shows a possible flow. The application uses <code>KeyManagerSupport</code> functions to perform
the checks and registration.
<pre>
    ...
    &#x40;Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

        checkAndSetKeyManager();
    }

    private void checkAndSetKeyManager() {
        if (!KeyManagerSupport.hasKeyManager(getPackageManager())) {
            Toast.makeText(this, "KeyManager not installed on this system.", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
        }
        else if (!KeyManagerSupport.signaturesMatch(getPackageManager(), getPackageName())) {
            Toast.makeText(this, "KeyManager signature does not match.", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
        }
        else {
            hasKeyManager = true;
            long token = KeyManagerSupport.registerWithKeyManager(getContentResolver(), getPackageName(), "SilentPhone");
            if (token == 0) {
                Toast.makeText(this, "Cannot register with KeyManager.", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
                hasKeyManager = false;
            }
        }
        // the onActivityResult calls keyManagerChecked if KM is ready to use. Otherwise we proceed
        // without key manager
        if (hasKeyManager) {
            startActivityForResult(KeyManagerSupport.getKeyManagerReadyIntent(), KEY_MANAGER_READY);
        }
        else {
            keyManagerChecked();    // run without key manager - functions shall check 'hasKeyManager'
        }
    }

    &#x40;Override
    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {

        if (requestCode == KEY_MANAGER_READY) {
            if (resultCode != RESULT_OK) {      // Currently this never happens
                Toast.makeText(this, "KeyManager READY request failed - exit.", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
                exitApplication();
            }
            else {
                Toast.makeText(this, "KeyManager READY request OK.", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
                keyManagerChecked();
            }
        }
    }

    // This is the second half of onCreate after check of key manager availability etc.
    private void keyManagerChecked() {
        if (!hasKeyManager) {
            ... do without key manager ...
        }
        else {
            ... do with key manager ...
        }
    }
</pre>

The above code shows that the application starts the key managers activity to check if the key manager is ready,
i.e. is <em>unlocked</em>. If the key manager is unlocked then the key manager returns immediately without any
user interaction. If the key manager is locked it starts its UI and asks the user for the password to unlock. Once
the unlock was successful the key manager returns with <code>RESULT_OK</code>.
<p/>
Currently the user cannot skip password entry. Thus if the key manager is available and the application asks it to
become <code>READY</code> the user cannot abort this action. An application may set-up some timeout mechanism to
proceed after some time in case a user does not enter a password and thus the key manager cannot unlock the key store.
<p/>
<b>TBD:</b> need some agreement if this behaviour is OK and/or which actions to take if the key manager is available
but never gets <code>unlocked</code>. Should we assume a non-authorized usage in this case?

<h3>Using key data access functions</h3>

The key manager stores and returns <code>byte[]</code> only. To store and later retrieve character data, for example
passwords or other strings, applications could use transform functions.

To store character data an application may use the following sequence:
<pre>
    String passwordTest = "testäßüzrt";
    ...
    byte[] keyData = passwordTest.getBytes("UTF-8");
    KeyManagerSupport.storePrivateKeyData(resolver, keyData, "myKeyTag");
</pre>

To read and convert back to character data:
<pre>
    byte[] data = KeyManagerSupport.getPrivateKeyData(resolver, "myKeyTag");
    ...
    String passwordTest = new String(data, "UTF-8");
</pre>
Some hints regarding handling of password data. In general it's not a good idea to use Java <code>String</code>
to process password data. Strings are immutable and applications cannot clear the data. Please check the classes
<code>CharBuffer, ByteBuffer</code> and <code>Charset</code>. Together with <code>byte[]</code> and
<code>char[]</code> they provide mutable buffers. After an applications is done with password handling it should
clear the buffers as much as possible.


<h2>Shared data - currently used tag names</h2>

SilentCircle applications use the key manager to store and exchange some information to implement synchronized
provisioning and unique device identification. Currently (proposal) we have defined two shared data tag names:

<pre>
"device_authorization" - formerly know as 'API key', authorizes a device to use SilentCircle applications
"device_unique_id"     - a unique device id
</pre>

SilentCircle applications should check for these two names and use them if they are available. If they are not
available then the application should perform the necessary steps to set this data. In a first step generate a
unique device id and store it. Then perform the registration and provisioning steps. If the provisioning was
successful then the application got the authorization key (aka 'API key') and should store it.
<p/>
Other application should use this data to register and provision themselves without any user interaction.
